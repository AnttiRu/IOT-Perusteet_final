## ðŸš€ Manual Testing Recommendations

To complete verification, perform these manual tests:

### 1. Server Startup Test
```bash
cd TehtÃ¤vÃ¤4
node server.js
```
**Expected:** Server starts on port 3000 without errors

### 2. Dashboard Access Test  
Open: `http://localhost:3000`
**Expected:** Dashboard loads with empty charts and connection status

### 3. API Functionality Test
```bash
# Test sensor data submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sensors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id":"test_esp32","temperature":25.5,"humidity":65.0}'
```
**Expected:** 201 Created response with data ID

### 4. Discord Integration Test
1. Configure Discord webhook URL in `config.js`
2. Send sensor data via API
3. Check Discord channel for automatic message

### 5. Real-time Dashboard Test
1. Open dashboard in browser
2. Send sensor data via API
3. Verify dashboard updates automatically without refresh
